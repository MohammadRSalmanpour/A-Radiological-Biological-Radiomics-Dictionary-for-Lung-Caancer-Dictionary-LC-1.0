# A-Radiological-Biological-Radiomics-Dictionary-for-Lung-Caancer-Dictionary-LC-1.0
📘 Overview

Dictionary LC 1.0 is an open-source radiological–biological dictionary that connects Lung-RADS semantic descriptors with standardized radiomic features (RFs) extracted from CT scans. This framework provides clinicians, researchers, and AI practitioners with a clinically interpretable mapping between quantitative imaging biomarkers and radiologist-driven terminology.

The dictionary supports:

Explainable AI (XAI)

Interpretable machine learning for lung cancer

Radiomics feature standardization

CT-based nodule characterization

Multi-institutional reproducibility

This project accompanies the manuscript “A Radiological–Biological Radiomics Dictionary for Lung Cancer — Dictionary LC 1.0.”
